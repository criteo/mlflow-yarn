# mlflow-yarn

Backend implementation for running [MLFlow projects](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) against a Hadoop/YARN backend).

To activate just do 'pip install mlflow-yarn' along your mlflow environment. It will register the [plugin](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html) as an entrypoint with the YARN backend. 

```bash
$ pip install mlflow-yarn
```

mlflow-yarn only supports Python â‰¥3.6.

## Developement
